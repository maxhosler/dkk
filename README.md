# DKK Viewer

## Build

As a prerequisite, you'll need NodeJS installed.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. The relevant files will be in the `dkk` folder; just open `index.html`. If you want to move the `index.html` elsewhere, make sure to move `main.bundle.js` along with it.
